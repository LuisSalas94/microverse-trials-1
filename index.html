				<h3>Introducing JSX</h3>
				<p>
					This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML. It is called JSX,
					and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with
					React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of
					a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.
					JSX produces React “elements”. We will explore rendering them to the
					DOM in the next section. Below, you can find the basics of JSX
					necessary to get you started.
				</p>

				<code>
					<xmp>
            const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
          </xmp>
				</code>

				<p>
					React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled
					with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes
					over time, and how the data is prepared for display.
				</p>

				<p>
					Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and
					logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled
					units called “components” that contain both. We will come back to
					components in a further section, but if you’re not yet comfortable
					putting markup in JS, this talk might convince you otherwise.
				</p>

				<p>Embedding Expressions in JSX</p>
				<code>
					<xmp>
            const name = 'Josh Perez';
            const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
            ReactDOM.render(
              element,
            document.getElementById('root')
            );
          </xmp>

				<h3>Why Accessibility?</h3>
				<p>
					Web accessibility (also referred to as a11y) is the design and
					creation of websites that can be used by everyone. Accessibility
					support is necessary to allow assistive technology to interpret web
					pages. React fully supports building accessible websites, often by
					using standard HTML techniques.
				</p>

				<h3>WAI-ARIA</h3>
				<p>
					The Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet
					Applications document contains techniques for building fully
					accessible JavaScript widgets. Note that all aria-* HTML attributes
					are fully supported in JSX. Whereas most DOM properties and attributes
					in React are camelCased, these attributes should be hyphen-cased (also
					known as kebab-case, lisp-case, etc) as they are in plain HTML:
				</p>

				<code>
					<xmp>
            <input
            type="text"
              aria-label={labelText}
              aria-required="true"
              onChange={onchangeHandler}
              value={inputValue}
              name="name"
            />
          </xmp>
				</code>

				<h3>Semantic HTML</h3>
				<p>
					Semantic HTML is the foundation of accessibility in a web application.
					Using the various HTML elements to reinforce the meaning of
					information in our websites will often give us accessibility for free.
				</p>
				<code>
					<xmp>
             import React, { Fragment } from 'react';
            function ListItem({ item }) {
              return (
            <Fragment>
              <dt>{item.term}</dt>
              <dd>{item.description}</dd>
            </Fragment>
          );
        }
          </xmp>
				</code>

				<h3>React Top-Level API</h3>
				<p>
					React components let you split the UI into independent, reusable
					pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. React components can
					be defined by subclassing React.Component or React.PureComponent.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you don’t use ES6 classes, you may use the create-react-class
					module instead. See Using React without ES6 for more information.
				</p>
				<h3>Creating React Elements</h3>
				<p>
					We recommend using JSX to describe what your UI should look like. Each
					JSX element is just syntactic sugar for calling React.createElement().
					You will not typically invoke the following methods directly if you
					are using JSX.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>createElement()</li>
					<li>createFactory()</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Transforming Elements</h3>
				<p>React provides several APIs for manipulating elements:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>cloneElement()</li>
					<li>isValidElement()</li>
					<li>React.Children</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Introducing Hooks</h3>
				<p>
					Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and
					other React features without writing a class.
				</p>

				<code>
					<xmp
> 
              {
              "items": [
                { "id": 1, "name": "Apples",  "price": "$2" },
                { "id": 2, "name": "Peaches", "price": "$5" }
              ] 
            }

          </xmp>
				</code>

				<h3>AJAX and APIs</h3>
				<p>
					You can use any AJAX library you like with React. Some popular ones
					are Axios, jQuery AJAX, and the browser built-in window.fetch.
				</p>
				<h3>Where in the component lifecycle should I make an AJAX call?</h3>
				<p>
					You should populate data with AJAX calls in the componentDidMount
					lifecycle method. This is so you can use setState to update your
					component when the data is retrieved.
